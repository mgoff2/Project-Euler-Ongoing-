Stabs at + Thinking Through Project Euler Challenges

Project Euler solutions are provided by question number. Should I ever reach problem 100, I'll stop posting per community guidelines. Names are self-explanatory. The commenting throughout the codes refers to the process of thinking and debugging encountered along the way. If you're a beginner, maybe they'll resonate and/or clear some things up.
